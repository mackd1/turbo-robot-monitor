Ideas for implementation
 - Refine data collection for processes
   - Collect the number of TCP/UDP connections a process usually has open
   - Does finding the average number of TCP connections open really help?
 - Fix alert system
   - Don't send alerts based on time alone, create a new method that allows for togglable alerts
