Ideas for implementation
 - Refine data collection for processes
   - Collect the number of TCP/UDP connections a process usually has open
   - Does finding the average number of TCP connections open really help?
 - Fix alert system
   - Don't send alerts based on time alone, create a new method that allows for togglable alerts
 - Create "Open Folder" option for processes and resources
 - Identify processes by their absolute path, or maybe try hashing the file?

Process data to collect: 
 - name
 - id
 - num modules
 - num threads
 - num handles
 - mem used
 - base priority
 - cpu time
 - number of TCP connections open
